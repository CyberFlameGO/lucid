## Introduction

Lucid is currently in an embryonic state but we wish to achieve a fast, secure and distributed key-value store accessible through a HTTP API, we also want to propose persistence, encryption, websocket streaming, replication and a lots of features.

## Some Use Cases

- Private Keys Storing (for a wallet by example)
- IoT: collect and save statistics data
- A distributed cache for an application
- Service Discovery
- Distributed Configuration
