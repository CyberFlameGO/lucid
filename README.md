## Introduction

Lucid is currently in an embryonic state but we wish to achieve a fast, secure and distributed key-value store accessible through an HTTP API, we also want to propose persistence, encryption, WebSocket streaming, replication and a lot of features.

## Works Progress

<ins>__**Warning: Empty project for now, the development is ensured in the [development](https://github.com/lucid-kv/lucid/tree/development) branch.**__</ins>

- [x] Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
  - [x] Initialization process
  - [x] Configuration files handling
  - [x] JWT token Issuing
  - [ ] HTTPS Support
  - [x] Rest API
     - [x] Adding CORS
     - [x] KV-Base, HashMap-based
     - [x] JWT Authentication
- [ ] Web UI in VueJS

- [ ] Encryption (with Serpent Cipher)
- [ ] Access Control List (ACL)
- [ ] Server Sent Events (SSE)

## Some Use Cases

- Private Keys Storing (for a wallet by example)
- IoT: collect and save statistics data
- A distributed cache for an application
- Service Discovery
- Distributed Configuration
- Blob Storage

## Some Features

- RESTful HTTP API
- Web UI
- Persistence
- Encryption on the Fly (Serpent)
- Access Control List (ACL)
- Server Sent Events (SSE)
- Named Pipes

## Command Line Interface
